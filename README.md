## Public repository of [ASTRID](https://gtac-iteam-upv.github.io/Astrid/) Project




The general objective of [ASTRID](https://gtac-iteam-upv.github.io/Astrid/) project is to contribute to
sound-field deployment systems by the design and development of test beds, algorithms and
computational kernels, that improve the performance, increase the resiliency, and reduce the
energy consumption in order to transfer knowledge and tools to the productive sector. 

[ASTRID](https://gtac-iteam-upv.github.io/Astrid/) will
address complex sound deployment scenarios along three research fields: 
- Fast multichannel adaptive algorithms
- Distributed and collaborative systems
- Psychoacoustic aspects of listening


focused on four related application target domains: 
- Active sound field control
- Personal sound zones and spaces
- Speech masking for achieving Personal sound spaces
- Computational and matematical tools for sound processing

In this GitHub repository you will find software resources used in the development of this project.
